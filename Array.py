# Python Arrays
# Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.
# his page shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library, like the NumPy library.

# What is an Array?\
# An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
#
# If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:
#
# car1 = "Ford"
# car2 = "Volvo"
# car3 = "BMW"

# Access the Elements of an Array
# cars=["bmw","bmw1","bmw2","bmw3","bmw4"]
# for car in cars:
#     print(car)
